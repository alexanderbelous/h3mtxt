# Structured representation of a saved game (.CGM, .GM1, .GM2, ...)

This is experimental code - as far as I know, the saved game format hasn't been fully reverse-engineered yet. Maybe I'll be the first to crack it, lol.

As with [Map](../Map) and [Campaign](../Campaign), this library only deals with representation of the saved game. Serialization will be implemented in separate libraries.
